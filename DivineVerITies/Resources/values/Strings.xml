    Prayer is the application of one\'s heart towards God and the internal exercise of love towards Him. 
    In prayer, the one who is praying ought to be changed that he may receive life for the brother. 
    May the Lord help you understand further what prayer is and how we can pray for others and achieve results. 
    This is Part One of the message in this series. God bless you richly.
